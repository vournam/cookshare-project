1. Git clone the project from the above link locally on your computer.
2. Navigate to the location of the file in the terminal and then run: 

> npm init 
(this command will create the package.json file)

> npm install 
(this command will create the node_modules file with all the projectâ€™s dependencies in the package.json file)

After that, run from your terminal: 

> npm start (We used a nodemon to automatically update the server with each change. This was done in the terminal by downloading the module from the node package manager:

> npm install --save-dev nodemon
 
and then in the scripts of package.json we added in "scripts" the following:
"start": "nodemon app.mjs" )
